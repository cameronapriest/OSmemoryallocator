This is a memory allocator simulator written in C. Processes can be created
and subsequently released from simulated memory, creating a hole. Holes
can then be compacted together with all free memory. Sample output is
shown in "lab6.pdf."

When requesting a process, the name of the process must be a single
"P" followed by an integer. For example:
P1, P2, ... P143, ... P402394, etc.
